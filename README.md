# TFC Portal

The front-end to TFC's portal which you should be able to access once it is deployed. The website is supposed to serve competitive programming tutorials, problem editorials, and an open blog system. 

Here's the current progress by us.

### For Developers

Here's a brief "how to get started" with Next JS. This is not an official documentation nor it is exhaustive in explaining the concepts of Next JS. This is just a compilation of oversimplifications to get you started with this project. 

After you have pulled this entire repository, what you can do is open command prompt and type in `npm run dev` in the folder containing the repository. The website will appear in `http://localhost:3000`. 

`/pages` contains the pages in the website. For example `/pages/index.js` will serve as `https://website/`, `/pages/amongus.js` will render `https://website/amongus` and `/pages/[id].js` will render `https://website/1` (it can be any number not just 1). 

`/components` contains the other React components I used in making this website to simplify things. 

This project uses [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) to call the backend, and you can access and view the backend repository in this [link](https://github.com/joshjms/pyjudge). 

For the designs, I mainly use TailwindCSS and DaisyUI - and yes, I cannot design properly so if anyone wants to fix the UI that would be awesome. 

If there are any questions, feel free to message me in Discord, Telegram, or Whatsapp (if you are assigned to this project, you should know how to contact me). I am still new around these parts, please be kind to me UwU. 

### Afterword

For the developers I trust so much to take part in this project with me, do **NOT** push randomly to main.
